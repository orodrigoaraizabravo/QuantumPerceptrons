This is the code and data repository for arxiv:2211.07075 

The OTOC Numerics folder contains code and data pertinent to the investigations of the Quantum Perceptron's chaotic behavior. 
We find that the OTOCs decay exponentially at late times in a manner consistent with scrambling dynamics. 
We also find that the QPs frame potential differs from those of a unitary 2-design. 

The Pulsed output folder correspond to code and results showing that a perceptron can faithfully approximate any ML activation function. 

The QNTK numberics folder contains test of the QPs quantum neural tangent kernel. 

The Tensorly folder contains code for all other aspects presented in the paper. For more information, contact oaraizabravo@g.harvard.edu
